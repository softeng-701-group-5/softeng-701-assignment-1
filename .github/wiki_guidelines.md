# Wiki Guidelines

## Purpose
The purpose of the wiki is provide developers contributing to the project with a comprehensive resource that will assist them in maintaining or otherwise extending the project. When the developer asks 'why?', the wiki should have the answer.

## Formatting
GitHub uses its own version of the Markdown syntax and a guide has been published [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Wiki Structure
* A 'Home' page should describe the project and the contributors
* A 'Meeting Minutes' page should include meeting minutes from all group meetings, with different meetings divided into different sections.
* Various pages describing the implementation of the project e.g. 'Front-end', 'Back-end'
* A 'Future Work' page which suggests ways to extend the project for future contributors
* A 'Contributions' page, which provides an overview of how each contributor contributed to the project 
<!-- Waiting on clarification from Kelly on best way to handle listing contributions -->

### Home
The 'Home' page must include a list of contributors.
<!-- It may also provide an overview of the wiki, but this should be handled by meaningful page names -->

### Meeting Minutes
All meeting minutes should follow a consistent format and include (at minimum):
* Date
* Agenda
* Summary
* Action Items

### Implementation Documentation
There should be a page dedicated to each sub-group and a members of that group should maintain said page. Each page must include an *Overview*, describing its purpose and how it integrates with the overall project. It is also encouraged to list relevant features

### Future Work
When detailing future work, ensure that each feature is given a description that would be adequate.
<!-- Not sure about this one, maybe define a format with name, purpose, description, etc. -->

## Writing Style
Contributors to the wiki should ensure that they maintain a professional standard of prose, use the first person inclusive (i.e. "we did x because") and use the active voice instead of the passive voice where possible. Wikipedia provides a [good rundown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_style) on this.

## Markdown Style
- When creating unordered lists, `-` should be used instead of `*`.
- Line breaks should be a double new line; avoid the use of `<br>`

# Wiki Guidelines

## Purpose
The purpose of the wiki is provide developers contributing to the project with a comprehensive resource that will assist them in maintaining or otherwise extending the project. When the developer asks 'why?', the wiki should have the answer.

## Formatting
GitHub uses its own version of the Markdown syntax and a guide has been published [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Wiki Structure
* A 'Home' page should describe the project and the contributors
* A 'Meeting Minutes' page should include meeting minutes from all group meetings, with different meetings divided into different sections
* Various pages describing the implementation of the project e.g. 'Front-end', 'Back-end'
* A 'Contributions' page, which provides an overview of how each contributor contributed
* A 'Future Work' page which suggests ways to extend the project for future contributors

### Home
The 'Home' page must include a list of contributors. 
<!-- It may also provide an overview of the wiki, but this should be handled by meaningful page names -->

### Meeting Minutes
All meeting minutes should follow a consistent format and include (at minimum):
* Date
* Agenda
* Summary
* Action Items

### Implementation Documentation
There should be a page dedicated to each sub-group and a members of that group should maintain said page. Each page must include an *Overview*, describing its purpose and how it integrates with the overall project. It is also encouraged to list relevant features.

### Contributions
In order to ensure each contributor is credited fairly for their contributions, the contributions page should include a short summary of the features each contributor worked on, including non-technical contributions (i.e. documentation). Contributions are to be organised by assigned sub-group, even if a contributor contributed to more than one sub-group. An example format that the page should follow is given below.
```
## Front-end
### Jordan
I worked on x
### Matt
I worked on y
```

### Future Work
When suggesting future work, ensure that each feature is given a description that adequately describes why the feature should be implemented and provide some detail (if possible) as to how it could be implemented. An example format is given below.
```
## Name
### Description
### Reason 
```

## Writing Style
Contributors to the wiki should ensure that they maintain a professional standard of prose, use the first person inclusive (i.e. "we did x because") and use the active voice instead of the passive voice where possible. Wikipedia provides a [good rundown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_style) on this.

## Markdown Style
- When creating unordered lists, `-` should be used instead of `*`.
- Line breaks should be a double new line; avoid the use of `<br>`

![](https://github.com/softeng-701-group-5/softeng-701-assignment-1/workflows/feeder-workflow-ci/badge.svg?event=push)

A webapp for aggregrating media feeds from various services into a single, uniform display for user convenience.

We are using the React framework to manage the front-end UI and using a Java server utilising the Spring framework for the back-end. The back-end will call the API for the relevant media service and the front-end will visualise this data.

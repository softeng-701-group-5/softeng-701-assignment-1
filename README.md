# Media Feed Aggregrator
A webapp for aggregrating feeds from various media sites into a single, uniform display for user convenience.<br>

We are using the React framework to manage the front-end UI and using a Java server utilising the Spring framework for the back-end. The back-end will call the API for the relevant media service and the front-end will visualise this data.

#### Supported media feeds
* GitHub
* Reddit
* Spotify
* Twitter

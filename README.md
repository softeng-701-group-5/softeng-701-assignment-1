# Media Feed Aggregator
A webapp for aggregrating media feeds from various services into a single, uniform display for user convenience.

We are using the React framework to manage the front-end UI and using a Java server utilising the Spring framework for the back-end. The back-end will call the API for the relevant media service and the front-end will visualise this data.
